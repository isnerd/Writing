// OPENING: In 1907, the German inventor Nikola Tesla sold all his patents to Westinghouse, Inc., for a heavily discounted $216,000, including one for alternating current. In 1943, he died penniless. In 2014, another Tesla has given away its patents but signs are that this one will be way more successful. Through a blog post on June 12, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla Motors, announced that his company would be releasing all the patents it held on the brand of successful electric vehicles (EVs) it manufactures. A line in the post indicates he wants to avoid future patent-infringement lawsuits. How nice.

// Patents cut both ways. More popularly, they safeguard information and prevent others from employing it without paying its originators a license fee. On the other hand, patents also explicitly earmark some information as being useful and worth safeguarding over the rest. They serve as decoys although that isn't their primary purpose. Even after open-sourcing patents on the Tesla EVs, Musk is the proprietor of a lot of technical and managerial information - on how to put his patents to best use, for one - that his competitors are not going to mastery easily.

// Musk's biggest competitor was the Israeli entrepreneur Shai Agassi, whose Better Place powered over a thousand EVs before going bankrupt in 2012. It was Agassi who, in 2002, came up with the idea of a battery-swapping station in 2002 that Musk elegantly showcased in 2013. It would seem Musk executed plans better. Then again, Musk also banked on new battery recharging technology that emerged after Agassi's time. Interestingly, another thing that helped Tesla rise was because it pulled an Apple - not in terms of the patents but by making its own hardware and software. Agassi, however, relied on extant manufacturers to supply models with a battery-swapping slot.

// After Agassi's departure, Tesla was king in a kingdom of frozen lakes. As Musk wrote in his post: "electric car programs (or programs for any vehicle that doesnâ€™t burn hydrocarbons) at the major manufacturers are small to non-existent, constituting an average of far less than 1% of their total vehicle sales." Without competition, Tesla both controlled a market as well as left no room for errors for itself and witnessed no competing innovation to help support the wide market. Now, Big Cars like GM and Ford could leverage the patents to crawl into the EVs market - and hopefully keep it from imploding.

// Software engineers have widespread standards, automated version control, and systems in place to easily license and/or share code. Hardware engineers have... nothing popular or widespread, really. By releasing his patents, Musk may not have levelled the playing field but he's cleared the first hurdle toward something the smartphone industry still struggles to do because of its scale: standardization. Releasing his patents is a way for Musk to jumpstart innovation and indirectly force his peers to model their products around the mould Musk has perfected in the last seven years. And one immediate benefit he gets out of this is by being able to sell his batteries to future EV-makers because, hey, the specs are standardized.

// Tesla has over 40 supercharger stations across the USA, and some 20 in Europe. As a result, Tesla EVs have over 2,000 miles of road open to them - and this isn't included in the patents. Even if Big Cars build an efficient EV, Tesla will be, ahem, 2,000 miles ahead.
